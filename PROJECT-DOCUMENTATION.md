# Islamic Sources Platform - Project Documentation

## 📋 Project Overview

This is an Islamic knowledge platform similar to IslamQA.info, featuring a public website for Islamic content (posts, articles, questions, books, courses) and an admin dashboard for content management. The project follows a design-first approach with mock data implementation before backend integration.

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

When continuing development on this project:

1. **Start with Admin Dashboard**: The public website is complete and functional
2. **Use Mock Data as Reference**: The mock data structure should guide database schema design
3. **Maintain Design Consistency**: Follow the established design patterns and color scheme
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Each feature should be tested on multiple devices and browsers
5. **Document Changes**: Update this documentation as the project evolves

The project is well-structured and ready for backend implementation. The foundation is solid and follows modern web development best practices.
